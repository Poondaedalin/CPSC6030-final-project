# **Electric Vehicle Population Dashboard: Process Book**

------

## **Overview and Motivation**

Electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly becoming a cornerstone of sustainable transportation. As global environmental concerns grow, governments, organizations, and individuals are transitioning to cleaner energy alternatives. EVs provide an opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lower dependence on fossil fuels, and contribute to a greener future.

This project focuses on visualizing trends in EV adoption using publicly available data. By creating a dashboard with static visualizations implemented in D3.js, this project aims to highlight key insights into EV adoption patterns, popular manufacturers, and geographical hotspots of EV usage. These insights can guide decision-makers, manufacturers, and consumers in understanding EV trends and making informed choices.

The project's motivation stems from the need to bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights. While EV adoption data exists, visualizing it in an accessible and meaningful way ensures that stakeholders can leverage this information effectively. Additionally, this project emphasizes design evolution, showcasing how ideas transform into meaningful visualizations.

## **Related Work**

The design and implementation of this project were inspired by several existing dashboards and visualizations:

1. **Tesla’s Vehicle Registration Trends**: Visualizations that highlight the dominance of Tesla in the EV market were influential. These charts often use bar graphs and trend lines to show Tesla's market share growth over time.
2. **Energy Usage Dashboards**: Dashboards visualizing renewable energy adoption provided insights into how data can be grouped and presented geographically, emphasizing user-friendly interactivity.
3. **OpenStreetMap Heatmaps**: Geographical heatmaps inspired the use of choropleth maps to depict regional EV densities. The ability to use colors to represent data density is visually compelling and intuitive.
4. **Visualization Tools in Class**: Discussions about perceptual principles in class, such as the use of color gradients, data aggregation techniques, and spatial visualization, influenced the project's design decisions.

These examples emphasized the importance of balancing clarity, readability, and aesthetics in data visualization. By combining these principles with D3.js's powerful capabilities, this project aims to create a dashboard that is both functional and visually appealing.

## **Questions**

### Initial Questions

At the beginning of the project, the following questions were identified:

1. **Which EV manufacturers are most popular?** This question aimed to identify key players in the EV market and their dominance.
2. **How has EV adoption grown over time?** Exploring temporal trends provides insights into the trajectory of EV adoption.
3. **Which regions have the highest density of EVs?** This question focuses on understanding regional adoption patterns and potential hotspots.

### Evolved Questions

As the project progressed, additional questions emerged:

1. **Are certain EV models more popular in specific regions?** This question adds granularity to the regional analysis, linking specific models to geographical preferences.
2. **What trends are visible in EV range capabilities?** The evolution of battery technology and its impact on EV adoption became an area of interest.
3. **How does EV growth correlate with infrastructure?** Although infrastructure data was unavailable, this question highlighted the importance of contextualizing EV adoption trends.

The evolution of these questions reflects a deeper understanding of the dataset and the insights it can provide.

## **Data**

### Source

The dataset used for this project, **Electric Vehicle Population Data**, provides a wealth of information on EV registrations, including details on vehicle make, model, year, type, and geographical location.

### Cleaning and Preparation

The raw dataset required several preprocessing steps:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values in columns like `Electric Range` and `Postal Code` were imputed or removed to ensure data integrity.
2. **Geographical Data Cleanup**: Columns such as `County`, `City`, and `Vehicle Location` were normalized to standardize naming conventions and enable accurate mapping.
3. **Aggregation**: Data was aggregated by `County`, `Model Year`, and `Make` for easier analysis and visualization.
4. **Format Conversion**: Numerical columns like `Model Year` were converted to integers, and geospatial data was formatted for visualization purposes.

### Challenges

- **Inconsistent Location Data**: Some entries lacked precise `Vehicle Location` data, limiting the granularity of geographical analysis.
- **Electric Range Variability**: The range data varied significantly, making it challenging to identify clear patterns without normalization.

Despite these challenges, the dataset provided a robust foundation for creating meaningful visualizations.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis**

### Visualizations

1. **Line Chart: Temporal Trends**: A line chart showing the number of EV registrations by year revealed a steady upward trend, with significant growth post-2015.
2. **Bar Chart: Manufacturer Dominance**: A horizontal bar chart highlighted Tesla as the leading manufacturer, followed by Nissan and Chevrolet.
3. **Choropleth Map: Regional Distribution**: A heatmap visualized the density of EVs by county, with urban areas showing higher concentrations.

### Insights

- **Dominance of Tesla**: Tesla accounted for a significant portion of the dataset, particularly the Model 3.
- **Growth in EV Adoption**: Registrations increased significantly after 2015, likely driven by advancements in technology and incentives.
- **Urban Hotspots**: Counties with major metropolitan areas showed higher EV densities, indicating urban-centric adoption.

These insights guided the design of the final dashboard, emphasizing temporal, geographical, and manufacturer-specific trends.

## **Design Evolution**

### Initial Designs

The project began with basic wireframes:

- **Sketch 1**: A line chart for temporal trends with tooltips showing registration counts.
- **Sketch 2**: A bar chart displaying manufacturer dominance with filters for specific years.
- **Sketch 3**: A heatmap for geographical distribution with a gradient color scale.

### Iteration Process

1. **Feedback on Color Use**: The initial color palette was too vibrant, leading to distractions. A more subdued gradient was adopted for the heatmap.
2. **Labeling and Readability**: Early designs lacked clear axis labels and legends, which were added in subsequent iterations.
3. **Balancing Detail**: Some charts included excessive detail, such as every model year. These were simplified to improve clarity.

### Final Designs

The final visualizations balanced detail and readability:

- A **line chart** with clear annotations for significant milestones.
- A **bar chart** highlighting the top 5 manufacturers and their market share.
- A **choropleth map** with a tooltip showing county-level EV densities.
